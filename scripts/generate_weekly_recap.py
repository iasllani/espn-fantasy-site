Generate two things for the current season and write them to
docs/data/weekly_recap.json:

  - lastWeek: an explicit, vulgar recap of every matchup in the most
    recently completed week
  - thisWeek: an explicit, trash-talking preview of every matchup in the
    upcoming (not yet played) week

Always produces output -- if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY isn't set (or a given
matchup's call fails), that matchup just gets a plain factual line instead
of an AI one, so the "This Week" tab always has something real to show.

Usage:
